# Grind Timer

Grind Timer is a simple experience tracking addon for Elder Scrolls Online to track your leveling progress in a variety of metrics.

Any feedback or suggestions on how to improve Grind Timer is appreciated and welcome.

## Features
* Estimated time in hours and minutes until your goal
* Experience needed until your goal
* Estimated number of kills needed until your goal
* Estimated experience gain per hour
* Estimated number of levels gained per hour
* Kills in the last 15 minutes
* Estimated number dungeon runs needed until goal
* Estimated number of dolmens needed until goal

**Metric Notes:**

The dungeon run metric will update when you leave a dungeon and count the experience gained while inside as a single run. Exiting the dungeon before completion will still count any experience gained up to that point as a single run; for best accuracy I suggest not exiting until you are ready to reset and run again.

The dolmen metric will only update once you complete a dolmen for best accuracy.
